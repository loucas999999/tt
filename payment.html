                <p class="note__paragraph"> The pricing rule is pretty straightforward: the farther you are, the more you pay. It's like a delivery fee for services. The logic behind it is simple – the longer it takes to get there, the more it costs.The idea is that the extra effort and resources involved in reaching you add up. So, the bottom line is, if you're way out there, expect a bit more on the bill – distance comes with its own price tag.<br> <br> <img class="cyprus-map" src="Cyprus Prices.png"> <hr class="hr"><p class="note__paragraph">

This limitation is often in place to ensure a streamlined and efficient post-production process. By narrowing down your choices to a specified number, you not only help maintain the quality and coherence of the final collection but also facilitate a smoother editing workflow. It's a strategic decision aimed at delivering the best possible results within a reasonable timeframe. So, while it may feel like a constraint, this limit ultimately contributes to a more focused and polished outcome, ensuring that each selected photograph receives the attention it deserves during the post-production phase.</p> <hr class="hr"><p class="note__paragraph"> Photography sessions typically last for <strong class="highlight">2 hours</strong>, striking a balance between capturing diverse images and keeping subjects comfortable.
